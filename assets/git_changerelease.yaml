# Commands to run before committing the changelog and adding the tag.
# Therefore these can add content to be included into the release-
# commit. These commands have access to the `TAG_VERSION` variable
# which contains the tag to be applied after the commit. If the
# command specified here is prefixed with a `-` sign, the exit status
# will not fail the release process. If it is not prefixed with a `-`
# a non-zero exit status will terminate the release process. The
# commands will be run from the repostory root, so sub-dirs MUST be
# specified. All commands are run as `bash -ec "..."` so you can use
# bash inside the commands.
